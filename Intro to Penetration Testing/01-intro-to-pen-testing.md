# Intro to Penetration Testing

### Phases of Penetration Testing

1.  reconnaissance

    -   active/passive

    -   direct vs. proxy

2.  scanning

3.  access/exploit

4.  maintaining access

5.  covering tracks / reporting

This process repeats over and over

### Footprinting

Information is naturally disclosed everywhere. Simply put, penetration testers document information.

##### Info about target

-   organizational websites

-   directories

-   email

-   systems

##### Threats

-   how will information be used?

    -   ransomware

    -   social engineering

#### Basics of Footprinting

1.  Target

    -   firewall / intrusion detection

    -   internal DNS scheme

    -   private websites

        -   business internal websites can hold a lot of valuable information

    -   IRL ("**internal** access / tools") reconnaissance

        -   literal physical access to target

        -   shoulder surfing

        -   eavesdropping

2.  **external** access / tools

    -   telephone

    -   network

    -   public websites

    -   email

3.  gathering Information

    -   google search

    -   whois

    -   dns structure layout

    -   social networks

        -   highly popular?

        -   latest updates?

    -   IP ranges

    -   network blocks

    -   web server content

        -   directory structures

    -   source code

    -   website mirroring

        -   duplication for "homebrew"ing

    -   OS detection (client/server)

    -   directories / databases

    -   multiple search engines

    -   URL analysis

    -   google search

    -   people websites

        -   personal information

    -   financial websites

    -   job sites

        -   job listing information can glean information

    -   alert websites

        -   have information come to us

    -   archive sites

        -   cached content

        -   full copies of historical content

            -   archive.org

    -   web monitoring

        -   os system information

    -   patent / trademark

    -   customers

        -   integration with social media

        -   portals?

    -   press releases

    -   "google hacking"
